## More About Me – [Take a Look!](http://www.mjakaria.me) 

### Overview

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

## Environment Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv # Install virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
```

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Python for DevOps
Python is widely used in DevOps for automation, scripting, and integration tasks. It simplifies various DevOps processes, including automation, configuration management, and cloud orchestration.

In this guide, we’ll cover key DevOps tasks and demonstrate how Python can be used for automation and other DevOps-related tasks.

##### Pre-Requisite
- In [Python Basics](https://github.com/jakir-ruet/python-learning)
  - Variables, Data Types, and Operators
  - Control Structures (if, else, loops)
  - Functions and Modules
  - Exception Handling
  - File I/O (reading and writing files)
  - Basic understanding of Python libraries

- In [Linux/Unix Basics](https://github.com/jakir-ruet/ubuntu-server-administration)
  - Navigating the command line (using terminal commands)
  - File system structure
  - Processes and services management (e.g., ps, top, systemctl)
  - Permissions and users
  - Package management (e.g., apt-get, yum, pip)

- [Git and Version Control](https://github.com/jakir-ruet/git-github-learning)
  - Basic Git commands like git clone, git commit, git push, and git pull
  - Branching and merging strategies
  - Using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for collaboration

- [Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)](https://github.com/jakir-ruet/complete-cloud-computing-aws)
  - AWS: Learn how to interact with AWS services (e.g., `EC2`, `S3`, `Lambda`) using the `Boto3` library.
  - Azure: Use Python to interact with Azure resources via the azure SDK.
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Work with services like Google Compute Engine or Google Cloud Storage using the google-cloud-python library.

#### What is [Boto3?](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
Boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to automate AWS services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and more.

##### Install Process & AWS Configuration
```bash
pip install boto3
```
```bash
aws configure
```
